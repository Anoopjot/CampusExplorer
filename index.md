# Humber Campus Navigator
For students it is hard to navigate within the campus. We are designing an application which helps students to navigate within the campus from any point to any point in short time and less distance and it will show temperature and pressure at that point.This project will consist various sensors,from them, temperature sensor(TMP36), pressure sensor(STM32) and 9-axis IMU(LSM9DS0) are the major ones.

# Week 11
To reduce the confusion from week 10 I will write the build instructions for the steps I took in week 9 in [readme.md](https://github.com/HumberCampusExplorer/CampusExplorer/blob/master/README.md)

# Week 10 (Nov 6)
Although, this week is PCB soldering milestone, but i am still trying to figure out my coding part for my raspberry pi, so that it can request data from ATtiny85 and display it. I am little bit behind according to my Schedule, but before i was kind of confused(how i am going to do my sensor project), but now i figured out the steps i need to follow, in order to accomplish my hardware part, After completing my raspberry pi coding part, i will try my best to pace up for my project, I don't have to do soldering part, i just have to assemble my sensor, ATtiny85 with raspberry pi, then i should be good. 

# Week 9 (Oct 30)
This Week was PCB designed milestone, and i programmed my ATtiny85, which is sending data to raspberry pi when requested. I uploaded the program to ATtiny85 using Arduino Uno(hardware) and a software "Arduino". 

# Week 8 (Oct 23)
This week was breadboard assembly milestone, but in my case, before assembling my breadboard, i need to program my ATtiny85 microcontroller - For that-> First i programmed arduino, so that it can program ATtiny85, then i have to program Attiny85, so that it can convert my voltage reading into analog reading and then to digital. And then, Finally, i need to program my raspberry pi, so that it can request data from ATtiny85 and display it.So, for this week i programmed my arduino and tested it using a test program(blink Led) anfd it was successful, and the led was blinking.

# Week 1 (Sept 4)
Main agendas of this week were Introduction, Crib pi, chosing sensor and project.
In week1, course outline and critical path of the course was introduced, and the professor told us what we will be doing in the coming weeks, then, there was a description of the hardware we will be using in the course and in the project.
